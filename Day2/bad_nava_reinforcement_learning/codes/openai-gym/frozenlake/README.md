# FrozenLake-v0

```
A frozenlake-v0 is a 4x4 grid world which looks as follows:
SFFF       (S: starting point, safe)
FHFH       (F: frozen surface, safe)
FFFH       (H: hole, fall to your doom)
HFFG       (G: goal, where the frisbee is located)
Additionally, there is a little uncertainity in the movement
of the agent.

Q Learning - A simple q Learning algorithm is employed for the task.
The q values are stored in a table and these are updated in each iteration
to converge to their optimum values.
